# Some resources for Machine Learning

## Table of Contents

- [Machine Learning](#machine-learning)
- [Deep Learning](#deep-learning)


## Machine Learning
There are many ML books, but most of them are encyclopedic. <br/>
I recommend to take a course using Murphy or Bishop book.

### Textbook
- Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Murphy) :sparkles:
- Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop) :sparkles:
- The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie et al.)
- Pattern Classification (Duda et al.)
- Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning (Barber)
- Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms (MacKay)

### Lecture
- [Stanford CS229 Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu)
- [Oxford Machine Learning](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/)


## Deep Learning
There are many good resources for deep learning. <br/>

### Textbook
- Deep Learning (Goodfellow et al.) :sparkles:

### Lecture
- [Stanford CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu)
- [Stanfrod CS224d Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing](http://cs224d.stanford.edu)


## Reinforcement Learning
For classic (non-deep) RL, Sutton & Barto is classic. <br/>
For deep RL, lectures and tutorials are

### Textbook
- Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Sutton & Barto) :sparkles:
