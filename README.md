# Some resources for Machine Learning

## Machine Learning

There are many ML books, but most of them are encyclopedic. <br/>
I recommend to take a course using Murphy or Bishop book.

### Textbook
- Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Murphy) :sparkles:
- Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop) :sparkles:
- The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie et al.)
- Pattern Classification (Duda et al.)
- Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning (Barber)
-Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms (MacKay)
